<p>The <strong>MUV</strong> platform is a Smart Mobility Management System designed to cater to both end-users in the urban mobility market and public administrators. It offers a comprehensive platform that addresses all aspects of urban mobility. The MUV architecture is divided into two main sectors: one for the final user and the other for mobility management officers. Each sector contains different modules.</p><p>The modules for mobility users include:</p><ul>  <li>City-Glance</li>  <li>City-Loop</li>  <li>City-Zen</li>  <li>City-Green</li></ul><p>The <strong>City-Glance</strong> module aims to reduce fragmentation among mobility actors and services. It provides users with reliable support for mobility choices and offers public administrators a comprehensive overview of local mobility. It serves as a single point of access for users and gives municipalities a clear view of city mobility dynamics.</p><p>The <strong>City-Loop</strong> module focuses on enhancing the experience of mobility users, treating them as valued customers. It acts as a concierge service, emphasizing user satisfaction as a central goal for public administrators managing mobility.</p><p>The <strong>City-Zen</strong> module engages and empowers users by allowing them to send feedback on mobility conditions, such as traffic jams or busy buses. Feedback is georeferenced and shared with other users and the municipality. A "karma" system allows users to rate feedback, and a rewarding system incentivizes user participation through seniority levels and rewards.</p><p>The <strong>City-Green</strong> module supports municipalities in promoting modal shifts to low-emission transportation. Users can create profiles with specific trips and track green trips, earning a green score validated by an algorithm. This score can be linked to external reward systems like GreenApes.</p><p>For mobility managers, MUV offers three modules: a <strong>Planning Tool</strong> for designing urban mobility services, management services for overseeing mobility services, and <strong>MUVâ€™s Analytics</strong> for analyzing and reporting on urban mobility dynamics.</p>

<p>The <strong>MUV</strong> platform is a Smart Mobility Management System designed to cater to both end-users in the urban mobility market and public administrators. It offers a comprehensive platform that addresses all aspects of urban mobility. The MUV architecture is divided into two main sectors: one for the final user and the other for mobility management officers. Each sector contains different modules.</p><p>The modules for mobility users include:</p><ul>  <li>City-Glance</li>  <li>City-Loop</li>  <li>City-Zen</li>  <li>City-Green</li></ul><p><strong>City-Glance</strong> aims to reduce fragmentation among mobility actors and services. It provides users with reliable support for mobility choices and offers public administrators a comprehensive overview of local mobility. The goal is to create a single access point for users and provide municipalities with a clear city overview.</p><p>The <strong>City-Loop</strong> module focuses on enhancing the experience of mobility users, treating them as valued customers. It acts as a concierge service, emphasizing user satisfaction as a central aim for public administrators managing mobility.</p><p>The <strong>City-Zen</strong> module engages and empowers users by allowing them to send feedback on mobility status, such as traffic jams or busy buses. Feedback is georeferenced and shared with other users and the municipality. Users can comment and rate feedback through a "karma" system, linked to a rewarding system that creates seniority levels and rewards based on user activity.</p><p>The <strong>City-Green</strong> module supports municipalities in promoting modal shifts to low-emission transportation. Users can create profiles with specific trips and track green trips, earning a green score validated by an algorithm. This feature can integrate with external reward systems like GreenApes.</p><p>For mobility managers, MUV offers three modules: a <strong>Planning Tool</strong> for designing urban mobility services, management services for overseeing mobility services, and <strong>MUVâ€™s Analytics</strong> for analyzing and reporting on urban mobility dynamics.</p>

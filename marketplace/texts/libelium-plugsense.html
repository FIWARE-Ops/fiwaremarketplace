<p>Plug&amp;Sense! is a versatile product designed to cater to various applications by offering easy integration and maintenance of sensor networks. Its modular design allows users to quickly attach or replace sensor probes by simply screwing them into the bottom sockets, facilitating rapid deployment and cost-effective maintenance. This flexibility supports a wide range of vertical applications, including Smart Cities, Smart Agriculture, Industry 4.0, and Asset Tracking, with over 100 sensors available.</p><p>The product offers multiple power options, including internal and external solar panels, as well as USB recharging. The external solar panel is mounted on a 45ยบ holder for optimal performance in outdoor settings, while the internal panel is embedded in the enclosure, ideal for space-constrained environments. The rechargeable battery, with a capacity of 6600 mAh, ensures continuous operation even during low sunlight periods.</p><p>Plug&amp;Sense! is designed for easy outdoor installation, featuring holders for mounting on streetlights and building fronts. Metal cable ties allow for quick and secure attachment to posts, enabling rapid deployment. Once installed, the device automatically begins transmitting sensor data to the Gateway.</p><p>Communication between sensor nodes and the Gateway is facilitated through various radio options, including 802.15.4, 868, 900, WiFi, and 4G. The 4G radio can send data directly to the Cloud, bypassing the need for an intermediate Gateway. Sigfox and LoRaWAN modules provide long-range connectivity, ideal for IoT applications.</p><p>The 4G module includes a GPS receiver for real-time tracking applications, enhancing its utility in asset tracking and location-based services. Additionally, Plug&amp;Sense! supports common industrial communication protocols such as RS-232, RS-485, Modbus, 4-20 mA, and CAN Bus, making it suitable for industrial sensing, automation, military, automotive, and remote factory management applications.</p><p>Finally, models equipped with 4G radio feature an External SIM socket, allowing developers to easily switch carrier SIM cards for connectivity across various cellular networks, including 4G, 3G, GPRS, and GSM.</p>

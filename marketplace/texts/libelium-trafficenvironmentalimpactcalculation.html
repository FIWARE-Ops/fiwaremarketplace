<p>The Libelium Traffic Environmental Impact service offers a comprehensive solution for both citizens and public authorities to monitor and manage air quality and emissions in real-time. This service is particularly valuable as concerns about air pollution and its detrimental effects on health continue to grow. By providing accurate and timely emissions data, the service enables stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding environmental and public health policies.</p><p>One of the primary use cases of this service is the real-time monitoring of air quality through IoT devices. These devices calculate official World Health Organization (WHO) indicators, allowing for precise tracking of air pollution levels. This data is crucial for identifying and controlling critical pollution areas, thereby helping to mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution on public health.</p><p>Additionally, the service includes traffic and pollution dispersion models. These models are instrumental in understanding how pollutants spread across different areas, which is essential for effective traffic management and urban planning. By sourcing and clustering air pollutants, authorities can better predict and manage pollution hotspots.</p><p>The service also provides the ability to forecast emissions, which is vital for planning and implementing Low Emission Zones (LEZ) and other regulatory measures. By predicting the impact of these measures on city traffic, authorities can optimize their strategies to reduce emissions and improve air quality.</p><p>For citizens, the service offers valuable insights for planning outdoor activities and making informed mobility decisions. By staying informed about traffic emissions, individuals can choose routes and times that minimize their exposure to pollutants, thereby promoting intelligent mobility and sustainable actions.</p><p>Overall, the Libelium Traffic Environmental Impact service enhances environmental awareness and supports the development of policies and actions that contribute to a healthier and more sustainable urban environment.</p>

<p>The <strong>Thinking Cities</strong> platform is a comprehensive solution designed to enhance city services through a series of modules that facilitate data acquisition, processing, storage, and distribution. This platform supports various city services, IoT solutions, and data analytics, adhering to the standards set by the European FIWARE initiative.</p><p>The platform's functionality revolves around the data lifecycle and client-related aspects, categorized into four main use cases:</p><ul>    <li><strong>Data Insertion:</strong> Acquiring data from sensors and external systems for storage on the platform.</li>    <li><strong>Data Transformation:</strong> Processing available data to generate new insights.</li>    <li><strong>Data Query:</strong> Visualizing and extracting stored data for end-users or other modules.</li>    <li><strong>Data Sending:</strong> Sending notifications or commands based on data entry or administrative tasks.</li></ul><p>The platform comprises several key modules:</p><ol>    <li><strong>IoT Agents:</strong> Collects device observations and transforms them into NGSi events for application consumption and command sending.</li>    <li><strong>Context Broker (Orion):</strong> Manages context information, implementing the FIWARE Generic Enabler Publish/Subscribe Context Broker with NGSI interfaces.</li>    <li><strong>NGSI Data Adapter (Cygnus):</strong> Processes data from the Context Broker, adapting it for various sinks like MySQL, CKAN, Hadoop, or Mongo.</li>    <li><strong>Open Data Portal (CKAN):</strong> Manages and publishes data collections, widely used by governments and research centers.</li>    <li><strong>Short-term Historic (STH):</strong> Stores and retrieves processed data in raw or aggregated forms.</li>    <li><strong>Analytical Database (ADB):</strong> Provides stored data to the presentation layer.</li>    <li><strong>Business Intelligence (BI):</strong> Core component of the presentation layer.</li>    <li><strong>ETL Tools:</strong> Extracts, transforms, and loads data from external sources into the platform.</li>    <li><strong>Complex Event Processor (CEP):</strong> Analyzes real-time event data for immediate insights and responses.</li>    <li><strong>Big Data Analysis (Hadoop):</strong> Framework for large-scale dataset storage and processing.</li>    <li><strong>Identity Manager, Policy Enforcement, Policy Administration (IDM&amp;AUTH):</strong> Manages identity, authentication, and authorization.</li>    <li><strong>Administration Portal:</strong> User interface for managing services, users, entities, devices, and rules.</li></ol>

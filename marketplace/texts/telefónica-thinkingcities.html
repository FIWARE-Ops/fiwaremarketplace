<p>The <strong>Thinking Cities</strong> platform is a comprehensive solution designed to enhance city services through a series of modules that facilitate data acquisition, processing, storage, and distribution. This platform supports various city services, vertical IoT solutions, and data analytics, leveraging standards and interfaces from the European FIWARE initiative.</p><p>The platform's functionality revolves around the data lifecycle and client-related aspects, categorized into four main use cases:</p><ul>    <li><strong>Data Insertion:</strong> Acquiring data from sensors and external systems for storage on the platform.</li>    <li><strong>Data Transformation:</strong> Processing available data to generate new insights.</li>    <li><strong>Data Query:</strong> Visualizing and extracting stored data for end-users or other modules.</li>    <li><strong>Data Sending:</strong> Sending notifications or commands based on data entry or administrative tasks.</li></ul><p>The platform comprises several key modules:</p><ol>    <li><strong>IoT Agents:</strong> Collects device observations and transforms them into NGSi events for the Context Broker.</li>    <li><strong>Context Broker (Orion):</strong> Manages context information, providing NGSI interfaces.</li>    <li><strong>NGSI Data Adapter (Cygnus):</strong> Processes data from the Context Broker and adapts it for various sinks like MySQL, CKAN, Hadoop, or Mongo.</li>    <li><strong>Open Data Portal (CKAN):</strong> Manages and publishes data collections, widely used by governments and research centers.</li>    <li><strong>Short-term Historic (STH):</strong> Stores and retrieves processed data in raw or aggregated forms.</li>    <li><strong>Analytical Database (ADB):</strong> Provides stored data to the presentation layer.</li>    <li><strong>Business Intelligence (BI):</strong> Core component of the presentation layer.</li>    <li><strong>ETL and ESB Tools:</strong> Load external data into the platform, transforming it for compatibility.</li>    <li><strong>Complex Event Processor (CEP):</strong> Analyzes real-time event data for immediate insights and responses.</li>    <li><strong>Big Data Analysis (Hadoop):</strong> Framework for large-scale dataset processing.</li>    <li><strong>Identity Manager, Policy Enforcement, Policy Administration (IDM&amp;AUTH):</strong> Manages identity, authentication, and authorization.</li>    <li><strong>Administration Portal:</strong> User interface for managing services, users, and platform operations.</li></ol>

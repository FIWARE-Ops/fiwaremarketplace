<p>The WiseTown Open Data Manager is a versatile tool designed to streamline the management and publication of open data for smart cities. One of its primary use cases is the aggregation and organization of data based on customizable criteria, allowing city administrators to efficiently compile comprehensive Open Data catalogs. These catalogs are crucial for enhancing transparency and fostering civic engagement by making data accessible to the public.</p><p>Another significant use case is its compliance with GDPR regulations. The tool ensures that all data handling processes adhere to privacy laws, which is essential for cities operating within the European Union. This compliance is achieved through its three-tiered security system. The first level securely stores complete datasets, the second level processes data by removing sensitive information, and the third level provides a sanitized version of the data, free from any non-disclosable information. This third level is particularly useful for creating datasets that can be safely published on public portals without compromising individual privacy.</p><p>The WiseTown Open Data Manager also supports the publication of data through both public and non-public portals. This flexibility allows city officials to control the dissemination of information, ensuring that sensitive data is only accessible to authorized personnel while still promoting open data initiatives. By providing links to these portals, the tool facilitates easy access to data for various stakeholders, including researchers, developers, and the general public.</p><p>Furthermore, the tool's ability to customize data aggregation criteria makes it adaptable to the unique needs of different cities. Whether a city is looking to improve urban planning, enhance public services, or boost economic development, the WiseTown Open Data Manager can be tailored to support these objectives by providing relevant and actionable data insights.</p>

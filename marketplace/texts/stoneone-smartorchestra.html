<p>The SmartOrchestra platform addresses the need for a universal operating system in the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape, enabling diverse use cases through a comprehensive suite of functionalities. It facilitates the setup of marketplaces by integrating cyber-physical systems (CPS) and technologies like sensors and actuators into SmartServices. Utilizing FIWARE technology, such as the FIWARE Context Broker, SmartOrchestra manages data and memory for these components, ensuring a seamless and secure integration process.</p><p>SmartOrchestra's open platform allows for the safe orchestration and marketing of smart services tailored for cyber-physical applications. Its primary goal is to establish an open, standardized service platform that supports both public administrative and business-related services. By adopting a trustworthy marketplace model, SmartOrchestra designs, provides, and markets these services, integrating existing CPS solutions and sensor data with actuator functionalities to offer component services to third parties.</p><p>The platform's cloud-based architecture enables the combination of smart commercial and public services, fostering innovative solutions. For instance, smart waste containers can transmit their fill levels to municipal waste services, optimizing waste management by allowing flexible disposal schedules rather than fixed ones. This approach enhances efficiency and cost-effectiveness in waste management.</p><p>SmartOrchestra functions as both a transparent catalog for evaluating services and an operational platform interfacing control devices with sensor units. It serves as an open, secure, and standardized Smart Service Platform, combining the roles of an operational platform, marketplace, broker, and notary for cloud-based operations. Users of cyber-physical systems can choose their control applications freely, independent of the manufacturer's software, across various devices like smartphones, tablets, or personal computers.</p><p>The marketplace offers general user interfaces via generic APIs, enabling software usage across multiple devices. By securely connecting and orchestrating cyber-physical applications as Smart Services, SmartOrchestra facilitates the development of new and innovative business models.</p>

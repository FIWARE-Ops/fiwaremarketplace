<p>The solution is designed to enhance the management and utilization of car parks by leveraging advanced artificial intelligence algorithms. This innovative system is capable of detecting vehicles and generating comprehensive statistics, such as the distribution of parking times, identification and counting of carpoolers, and tracking of "suction cars"â€”vehicles that occupy parking spaces without contributing to the intended use of the facility. These insights are presented through a user-friendly, customized dashboard, providing stakeholders with valuable data to optimize car park operations.</p><p>One of the primary use cases of this solution is to accurately determine the occupancy rate of a car park. By understanding how full the parking facility is at various times, operators can make informed decisions about capacity management and future expansion needs. Additionally, the system can identify whether the car park is being utilized for carpooling purposes. This information is crucial for organizations aiming to promote sustainable transportation options and reduce traffic congestion.</p><p>Another significant use case is the estimation of CO2 emissions avoided due to carpooling activities facilitated by the car park. By encouraging carpooling, the solution not only supports environmental sustainability but also provides quantifiable data on the positive impact of these efforts. This can be particularly beneficial for companies and municipalities looking to meet environmental goals and demonstrate their commitment to reducing carbon footprints.</p><p>Furthermore, the solution can identify if the car park is being used for unintended purposes, such as by "suction cars." These vehicles may occupy spaces without contributing to the primary objectives of the car park, such as supporting local businesses or facilitating commuter carpooling. By detecting these patterns, operators can implement strategies to discourage such usage and ensure the car park serves its intended purpose effectively.</p>

<p>The solution is designed to enhance the management and utilization of car parks by leveraging advanced artificial intelligence algorithms. This innovative system is capable of detecting vehicles and generating comprehensive statistics, such as the distribution of parking times, identification and counting of carpoolers, and tracking of "suction cars"â€”vehicles that occupy parking spaces without contributing to the intended use of the facility. These insights are presented through a user-friendly, customized dashboard, providing stakeholders with valuable data to optimize car park operations.</p><p>One of the primary use cases of this solution is to accurately determine the occupancy rate of a car park. By understanding how full or empty a parking facility is at various times, operators can make informed decisions about capacity management and future planning. Additionally, the solution can identify whether the car park is being utilized for carpooling purposes. This is particularly beneficial for organizations or municipalities aiming to promote shared transportation as a means to reduce traffic congestion and environmental impact.</p><p>Another significant use case is the estimation of CO2 emissions avoided due to carpooling activities facilitated by the car park. By encouraging carpooling, the solution helps in reducing the number of vehicles on the road, thereby contributing to lower carbon emissions. This data can be crucial for sustainability reporting and for demonstrating the environmental benefits of the car park.</p><p>Furthermore, the solution can detect if the car park is being used for unintended purposes, such as identifying "suction cars" that occupy spaces without contributing to the car park's primary objectives. This capability allows operators to address misuse and ensure that the facility serves its intended purpose effectively.</p><p>Overall, this solution provides a comprehensive tool for car park management, offering insights that drive operational efficiency, environmental sustainability, and strategic planning.</p>

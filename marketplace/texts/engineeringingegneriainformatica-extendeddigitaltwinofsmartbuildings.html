<p>The <strong>eXtended Digital Twin (XDT)</strong> solution offers a comprehensive platform for managing and optimizing building operations through its integration with the Digital Enabler ecosystem. This platform is designed to be open and highly scalable, providing APIs and connectors for integrating diverse data sources, including sensors, user feedback, and third-party applications. It supports advanced device management both in the cloud and at the edge, enabling real-time data collection and processing.</p><p>Key use cases for the XDT include enhancing energy efficiency, improving perceived well-being within buildings, and promoting sustainability. The platform achieves this by utilizing algorithms that analyze data to provide insights and forecasts, allowing for the optimization of building performance. A dedicated web app is available for energy managers, HR managers, and facility managers to manage Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) aspects of the building.</p><p>The XDT distinguishes itself from traditional Building Information Modeling (BIM) by enabling real-time interaction between the physical building and its virtual model. While BIM requires manual updates, the XDT leverages IoT technologies for automatic, bidirectional data transfer, ensuring the virtual model reflects the current state of the physical building. This capability allows for simulations and future performance forecasting, enhancing the building's operational efficiency.</p><p>Data collection is facilitated by the IoT Device Manager, which integrates devices from various vendors and supports multiple IoT protocols. Once data is collected, it is harmonized using the Data Mashup Editor, which processes and represents data in NGSI-LD format using Smart Data Models. This harmonized data is then analyzed both at the edge for immediate responses and in the cloud for historical analysis and AI model training. The solution provides insights into indoor comfort and productivity, displaying this information in the building's Digital Twin through AI-based algorithms.</p>

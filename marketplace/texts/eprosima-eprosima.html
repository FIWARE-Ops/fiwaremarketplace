<p><strong>eProsima</strong> offers a range of middleware solutions that cater to various industries, particularly focusing on real-time systems. One of the primary use cases for eProsima's products is in the field of robotics. Fast DDS, a middleware implementation, is widely used in larger robotic systems such as ROS 2. This allows for efficient communication and data exchange between different components of a robotic system, ensuring seamless operation and coordination. Additionally, Micro XRCE-DDS serves as the default middleware for micro-ROS, which is specifically designed for microcontrollers. This makes it ideal for smaller, resource-constrained robotic applications where efficient data handling is crucial.</p><p>In the Internet of Things (IoT) sector, eProsima's middleware solutions enable devices to communicate effectively in real-time. The Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard, which eProsima adheres to, facilitates the reliable and scalable exchange of data across various IoT devices. This is particularly beneficial in environments where numerous devices need to interact and share data continuously, such as smart homes, industrial automation, and healthcare monitoring systems.</p><p>The automotive industry also benefits from eProsima's middleware solutions. With the increasing complexity of modern vehicles, there is a growing need for robust communication systems that can handle the vast amount of data generated by various sensors and control units. eProsima's DDS middleware provides a reliable framework for data distribution, ensuring that critical information is shared promptly and accurately across different vehicle systems. This is essential for the development of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles, where real-time data processing is vital for safety and performance.</p><p>Overall, eProsima's middleware solutions are versatile and can be applied to any industry that requires efficient, real-time data distribution and communication. Their adherence to the OMG DDS standard ensures compatibility and reliability, making them a preferred choice for developers and engineers working on complex, data-driven systems.</p>

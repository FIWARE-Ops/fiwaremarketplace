<p>Bettair offers a comprehensive solution for urban air pollution mapping, providing a range of use cases that can significantly benefit big cities. The platform's ability to deploy a large number of highly accurate gas sensors allows for detailed pollution mapping, which is crucial for urban planning and public health initiatives.</p><p>One primary use case is for city planners and environmental agencies to monitor air quality in real-time. By deploying Bettair's static nodes across various locations, cities can gather data on pollutants such as NO2, NO, CO, H2S, O3, and SO2, as well as particulate matter like PM1, PM2.5, and PM10. This data can inform decisions on traffic management, industrial regulation, and green space development to improve air quality.</p><p>Another use case is in public health. Health organizations can use the detailed pollution maps generated by Bettair to identify areas with high pollution levels and correlate them with health issues such as asthma or cardiovascular diseases. This information can guide public health advisories and interventions, targeting vulnerable populations and reducing health risks associated with air pollution.</p><p>Bettair's platform is also valuable for research and academic institutions studying the impacts of air pollution. The high-resolution data provided by the sensors can support studies on pollution trends, the effectiveness of pollution control measures, and the relationship between pollution and climate change.</p><p>Additionally, Bettair can be used by smart city initiatives to integrate air quality data with other urban data systems. This integration can enhance urban living by providing citizens with real-time air quality information through mobile apps or public displays, empowering them to make informed decisions about their daily activities.</p><p>Overall, Bettair's pollution mapping tools offer a versatile solution for cities looking to tackle air pollution, improve public health, and enhance the quality of urban life through data-driven decision-making.</p>

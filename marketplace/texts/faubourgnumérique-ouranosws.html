<p>The <strong>ouranos-ws</strong> platform offers a comprehensive solution for managing virtualized assets as digital twins, leveraging the capabilities of NGSI-LD. It is designed to cater to various use cases through its three main feature groups: Design, Navigate, and Control.</p><p><strong>Design</strong> is the first step in utilizing ouranos-ws, where users can create specific data models tailored to their needs. This feature allows for the customization of data models, enabling users to either develop new models or adapt existing ones, particularly those from the Smart Data Models initiative. This flexibility ensures that users can efficiently model their digital twins to reflect real-world assets accurately.</p><p><strong>Navigate</strong> is the next phase, where users can explore and manage their digital twin ecosystems. This feature provides tools to traverse through graphs of entities and relationships, facilitating the creation and updating of related objects. It is particularly useful for users who need to maintain a dynamic and interconnected digital twin environment, ensuring that all entities and their interactions are accurately represented and up-to-date.</p><p><strong>Control</strong> is the final feature group, focusing on managing interactions with other systems. This includes handling security layers, subscription, and registration mechanisms. Users can ensure secure and efficient communication between their digital twins and external systems, maintaining data integrity and security. This feature is crucial for users who need to integrate their digital twins with broader IoT ecosystems or other digital platforms, providing a seamless and secure interaction layer.</p><p>Overall, ouranos-ws is a versatile platform that supports the entire lifecycle of digital twin management, from design to navigation and control, making it an invaluable tool for organizations looking to leverage digital twin technology effectively.</p>

<p>The <strong>ouranos-ws</strong> platform offers a comprehensive solution for managing virtualized assets as digital twins, leveraging NGSI-LD capabilities. It is designed to cater to various use cases through its three primary feature groups: Design, Navigate, and Control.</p><p><strong>Design</strong> is the first step in utilizing ouranos-ws, where users can create specific data models tailored to their needs. This feature allows for the customization of data models, enabling users to either develop new models or adapt existing ones, particularly those from the Smart Data Models initiative. This flexibility ensures that users can efficiently model their digital twins to reflect real-world assets accurately.</p><p><strong>Navigate</strong> is the next phase, where users can explore and manage their digital twin ecosystems. This feature provides tools to traverse graphs of entities and relationships, facilitating the creation and updating of related objects. By navigating through these interconnected entities, users can gain insights into the structure and dynamics of their digital twin environments, ensuring that all components are accurately represented and up-to-date.</p><p><strong>Control</strong> is the final feature group, focusing on managing interactions with other systems. This includes handling security layers, subscription, and registration mechanisms. By controlling these interactions, users can ensure secure and efficient communication between their digital twins and external systems. This feature is crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the digital twin ecosystem, allowing for seamless integration and operation within broader IoT and data management frameworks.</p><p>Overall, ouranos-ws provides a robust platform for organizations looking to harness the power of digital twins. By offering tools for designing, navigating, and controlling digital twin environments, it supports a wide range of applications, from smart city management to industrial IoT solutions, enhancing operational efficiency and decision-making processes.</p>

<p>Orchestra Cities, developed by Martel Lab, is a smart city data-management platform designed to integrate and manage data from various city verticals. It leverages FIWARE and other open-source technologies to consolidate data from sensors, legacy systems, and citizen inputs into a single platform. This facilitates collaborative data and service management among different cities and stakeholders.</p><p>The platform offers several key functionalities, including:</p><ul>  <li>Flexible dashboard creation with maps and graphs, enabling easy data visualization and sharing.</li>  <li>Integrated management of APIs, both from Orchestra Cities and third parties, with robust access policies and fault-tolerance features.</li>  <li>Data management based on open standards, supporting both real-time and historical data.</li>  <li>Centralized IoT management, allowing integration of live data from various sensors and devices.</li>  <li>Advanced data privacy controls, ensuring data owners maintain control over their data.</li>  <li>A visual data ingestion service for designing data pipelines to populate the platform with data from various sources.</li></ul><p>These functionalities are available in the cloud, providing high availability and scalability, with options for private deployments for individual customers.</p><p>Orchestra Cities is a valuable tool for smart city managers globally and is a contender in the SELECT for Cities competition. The platform's design is being refined through collaboration with Antwerp, Copenhagen, and Helsinki, allowing for real-world testing and validation. Use cases include:</p><ul>  <li>Reducing traffic congestion in Antwerp through intelligent decision-making based on sensor and service data.</li>  <li>Monitoring pre-diabetes patients in Helsinki with GDPR-compliant management of smart home data.</li></ul>

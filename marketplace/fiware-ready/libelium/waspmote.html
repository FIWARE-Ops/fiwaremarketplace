  <h1>FIWARE-Ready: Libelium - Waspmote (Internet of Things,Cloud Computing,Sensory Systems)</h1>
  <p>
   Waspmote hardware architecture has been specially designed to work with extremely low consumption. Digital switches allow to turn on and off any of the sensor interfaces as well as the radio modules.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Waspmote</strong> hardware architecture has been specially designed to work with extremely low consumption. Digital switches allow  turning on and off any of the sensor interfaces as well as the radio modules. Three different sleep modes make Waspmote the lowest consumption IoT platform in the market (7 ÂµA). There are more than 110 sensors available to connect to Waspmote: CO, CO2, soil moisture, wind, IR presence, humidity, temperature, pH, radiation, liquid, luminosity, etc. Our Sensor Boards allow developers to easily use sensors in Waspmote.</p> <p>There are 16 different wireless interfaces for Waspmote including long range (4G / 3G / GPRS / GPRS+GPS / LoRaWAN / LoRa / Sigfox / 868 MHz / 900 MHz), medium range (ZigBee / 802.15.4 / DigiMesh / WiFi) and short range (RFID/NFC / Bluetooth 2.1 / Bluetooth Low Energy). They can be used solely or in combination of two by using the Expansion Radio Board.</p> <p>Users can connect any sensor in industrial environments. Compatible with: RS-232, RS-485, Modbus, CAN Bus, 4-20mA.</p> <p>Over the Air programming (OTAP) enables software upgrades of the motes without the need of physical access. Software upgrades can be made in minutes and it is possible to choose between updating single nodes (unicast) or an entire network (broadcast).</p> <p>The encryption libraries for Waspmote ensure the authentication, confidentiality (privacy) and integrity of the information gathered by the sensors. To do so, different cryptography algorithms including AES 256, RSA 1024 and MD5 have been implemented.</p>

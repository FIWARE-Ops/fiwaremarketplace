  <h1>FIWARE-Ready: EGM - EdgeSpot (Internet of Things,Sensory Systems)</h1>
  <p>
   The device EdgeSpot is a highly scalable hardware and software platform that takes you from concept to market by accelerating the proof-of-concept phases.
  </p>
  <p><strong>The EdgeSpot</strong> allows the connection of sensors and actuators through all types of telecommunication networks for a wide variety of use cases.</p> <p>Its capabilities allow remote intelligent processing and control algorithms in the field (edge processing) while maintaining a low energy footprint. Powered by a battery, solar charge, or electrical network, it adapts to all situations.</p> <p>Once the use case is clarified, the card can be adjusted to meet the need at an optimized cost while reusing the software already developed.</p>
  <p>The EdgeSpot was designed to meet the requirements of flexibility, cost, and speed of implementation of the Internet of Things (IoT) world.</p>

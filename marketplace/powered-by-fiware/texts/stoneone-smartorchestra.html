<p>The SmartOrchestra platform addresses the need for a universal operating system in the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape, enabling diverse use cases by integrating cyber-physical systems (CPS) and technologies like sensors and actuators into SmartServices. Utilizing FIWARE technology, such as the FIWARE Context Broker, it manages data and memory for these components. SmartOrchestra provides a uniform service description and facilitates secure internet-based composition and integration of heterogeneous CPS and services through standardized cloud and orchestration technologies.</p><p>SmartOrchestra's open platform allows for the safe combination and orchestration of smart services for cyber-physical applications, enhancing their marketing potential. Its goal is to create an open, standardized service platform for public administrative and business-related services. By adopting the trustworthy marketplace paradigm, SmartOrchestra designs, provides, and markets these services, integrating existing CPS solutions and aggregated sensor data with actuator/control functionalities as component services for third parties.</p><p>The cloud-based service platform enables the combination of smart commercial and public services to deliver innovative solutions. For instance, smart waste containers can transmit their fill level data to municipal waste services, allowing for flexible and efficient waste management beyond fixed schedules. An open and secure marketplace is established to provide, utilize, and combine Smart Services flexibly.</p><p>SmartOrchestra functions as both a transparent catalog for evaluating suitable services and an operational platform interfacing control devices with sensor units and their applications. It serves as an open, secure, and standardized Smart Service Platform, combining features of an operational platform, marketplace, broker, and notary for cloud-based operations. Users of cyber-physical systems can choose their control applications freely, without being restricted to manufacturer-specific software.</p><p>The marketplace offers general user interfaces through generic APIs, enabling software usage across multiple devices. The open SmartOrchestra platform ensures secure connection and combination of cyber-physical applications as Smart Services, facilitating their orchestration and effective marketing, thereby fostering new and innovative business models.</p>

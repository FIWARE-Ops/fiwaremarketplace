  <h1>FIWARE R &amp; D Projects: DIH²</h1>
  <p>
   A Pan‐European Network of Robotics Digital Innovation Hubs using IDSA and FIWARE technologies as a reference architecture.
  </p>
  <h3 id="objective">Objective</h3> <p>DIH² is a network of 26 DIHs, with a target to reach over 170 DIHs. The sole aim of the network is to spark incremental (cut 50% cost of advance robotics solutions, double the growth of robotics market) and disruptive (maximum productivity &amp; optimum agility) innovations in over 300,000 Manufacturing SMEs and Mid-Caps. It will support SMEs in their Agile Production challenge (50% increase in productivity) and unleash their digitalization potential by enabling robot solutions that are more cost effective at lower lot sizes.</p> <p>DIH² relies on:</p> <ul> <li>A Common Open Platform Reference Architecture for Agile Production (COPRA-AP) -based on Industrial Data Space Reference Architecture Model and FIWARE technologies- to serve the needs of SMEs by means of a continuously growing set of Robotic-based Open Standard Enablers (ROSE-AP).</li> <li>A marketplace as one-stop-shop for SMEs to access essential services for digital transformation including business modelling, technical support, access to skills and finance.</li> <li>2 competitive Open Calls to launch an ambitious Technology Transfer Program with 260 Agility Audits, 26 cross-border Technology Transfer Experiments and 26 ROSE-AP, leveraging over 26M€ of public &amp; private funding in advance robotics solutions for Agile Production.</li> <li>Members deeply rooted in their regional Smart Specialization Strategy (bringing €5M additional funding on top of EU funds), ensuring ‘working distance’ services for every SME in Europe – whichever the sector, wherever the location, whatever the size.</li> <li>A Corporate Sponsorship Program from equipment and automation suppliers committed with the network to get access to wider market and latest research in robotics.</li> </ul> <p>DIH² will transform this network into a self-sustainable non-profit association with members all over Europe. DIH² will demonstrate that public funded research can help SMEs &amp; Mid-Caps achieve digital excellence and global competitiveness through adopting advanced robotics solutions in Agile Production.</p>

   Programming Platform for Intelligent Collaborative Deployments over Heterogeneous Edge-IoT Environments.
  </p>
  <h3 id="description">Description</h3> <p>INCODE envisions the design and development of an open platform for the deployment and dynamic management of end user applications, over distributed, heterogeneous and trusted IoT-Edge node infrastructures, with enhanced programmability features and tools at both the network infrastructure level and the service design and operational level.</p> <p>The platform is implemented following three innovative design approaches:</p> <ul> <li>The deployment and management of the applications is conducted by an orchestration framework that follows a vertical layered approach from the end user interface to the infrastructure management while spanning horizontally across the device-edge-core-cloud continuum. The deployment follows the user-defined networking and operational features of the application in its northbound interface and a tight integration with state-of-the-art IoT, edge/cloud computing, and networking platforms in its southbound interface through a well-define driver API framework. With this approach the full programmability and reconfigurability of resources across the continuum is enabled.</li> <li>An open and extensible, programming toolset facilitates application development and deployment for large swarms of devices at the edge through a multi-role Internal Developer Platform (IDP) and new feature development and testing.</li> <li>A secure and trusted framework for registering and authenticating IoT device and edge nodes entering the system as well as the data sharing and application deployment.</li> </ul> <p>The concept is tested and validated over a mature testing environment that integrates diverse IoT application areas in smart logistics, manufacturing, utility inspection, and community PPDR over a programable infrastructure extended to O-RAN, 5G, SDN enable core Cloud.</p> <p>The consortium addresses all the required development sectors from the platform technology innovations, to supported IoT infrastructure and applications, including the end user interfacing and resource management intelligence.</p>

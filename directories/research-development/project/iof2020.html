  <h1>FIWARE R &amp; D Projects: IOF2020</h1>
  <p>
   Internet of Food and Farm 2020. Building an ecosystem of farmers, food industry technologists and research institutes.
  </p>
  <h3 id="objective">Objective</h3> <p>The IoF2020 project is dedicated to accelerate adoption of IoT for securing sufficient, safe and healthy food and to strengthen competitiveness of farming and food chains in Europe.</p> <p>It will consolidate Europe’s leading position in the global IoT industry by fostering a symbiotic ecosystem of farmers, food industry, technology providers and research institutes.</p> <p>The IoF2020 consortium of 73 partners, led by Wageningen UR and other core partners of previous key projects such as FIWARE and IoT-A, will leverage the ecosystem and architecture that was established in those projects. The heart of the project is formed by 19 use cases grouped in 5 trials with end users from the Arable, Dairy, Fruits, Vegetables and Meat verticals and IoT integrators that will demonstrate the business case of innovative IoT solutions for a large number of application areas.</p> <p>A lean multi-actor approach focusing on user acceptability, stakeholder engagement and sustainable business models will boost technology and market readiness levels and bring end user adoption to the next stage.</p> <p>This development will be enhanced by an open IoT architecture and infrastructure of reusable components based on existing standards and a security and privacy framework.</p> <p>Anticipating vast technological developments and emerging challenges for farming and food, the 4-year project stays agile through dynamic budgeting and adaptive decision-making by an implementation board of representatives from key user organisations. A 6 M€ mid-term open call will allow for testing intermediate results and extending the project with technical solutions and test sites.</p> <p>A coherent dissemination strategy for use case products and project learnings supported by leading user organisations will ensure a high market visibility and an increased learning curve.</p> <p>Thus IoF2020 will pave the way for data-driven farming, autonomous operations, virtual food chains and personalised nutrition for European citizens.</p>

  <h1>FIWARE R &amp; D Projects: FIWARE4WATER</h1>
  <p>
   Linking water to FIWARE by defining standardised interfaces for both water sector end-users and solution providers.
  </p>
  <h3 id="digitalsolutionsforthefuturewatersmartcities">Digital solutions for the future Water Smart Cities</h3> <p>FIWARE4WATER project intends to replicate success stories by linking the water sector to FIWARE, an open-source IT platform created in 2011 under the Future Internet Public Private Partnership funded by the European Commission. The connection of the water sector to the FIWARE platform will contribute to the application of innovative digital solutions. In particular, it will make it possible to combine and process various data streams, into a standardised output, leading to a better and more sustainable use of resources.</p> <p>FIWARE4WATER solution will be first demonstrated in four demo cases covering a wide range of challenges, as exemplary paradigms of its potential. Then, the project will build and develop an EU and global community of adopters around the FIWARE4WATER ecosystem, as a go-to platform for innovative solutions and resource management.</p> <h3 id="objective">Objective</h3> <p>FIWARE is a smart solution platform, funded by the EC (2011-16) as a major flagship PPP, to support SMEs and developers in creating the next generation of internet services, as the main ecosystem for Smart City initiatives for cross-domain data exchange/cooperation and for the NGI initiative. So far little progress has been made on developing specific water-related applications using FIWARE, due to fragmentation of the water sector, restrained by licensed platforms and lagging behind other sectors (e.g. telecommunications) regarding interoperability, standardisation, cross-domain cooperation and data exchange.</p> <p>FIWARE4WATER intends to link the water sector to FIWARE by demonstrating its capabilities and the potential of its interoperable and standardised interfaces for both water sector end-users (cities, water utilities, water authorities, citizens and consumers), and solution providers (private utilities, SMEs, developers).</p> <p>Specifically we will demonstrate it is non-intrusive and integrates well with legacy systems. In addition to building modular applications using FIWARE and open API architecture for the real time management of water systems, FIWARE4WATER also builds upon distributed intelligence and low level analytics (smart meters, advanced water quality sensors) to increase the economic (improved performance) and societal (interaction with the users, con-consensus) efficiency of water systems and social acceptability of digital water, by adopting a 2-Tier approach: (a) building and demonstrating four Demo Cases as complementary and exemplary paradigms across the water value chain (Tier#1); (b) promoting an EU and global network of followers, for digital water and FIWARE (cities, municipalities, water authorities, citizens, SMEs, developers) with three complementary Demo Networks (Tier#2). The scope is to create the FIWARE4WATER ecosystem, demonstrating its technical, social and business innovative potential at a global level, boosting innovation for water.</p>

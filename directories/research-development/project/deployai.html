  <p>
   Development and deployment of the European AI-on-demand Platform
  </p>
  <h3 id="description">Description</h3> <p>The primary goal of DeployAI is to build, deploy, and launch a fully operational AI-On-Demand platform (AIoDP) promoting trustworthy, ethical, and transparent European AI solutions for use in the industry, mainly for SMEs, and in the public sector. The development of the AIoDP will be based on the requirements of the Pre-PAI and the ongoing AI4Europe projects. DeployAI will provide a comprehensive and Trustworthy AI (TAI) resource catalogue and marketplace, which offers responsible AI resources, and tools, ensuring easy access for end-users (SMEs, public sector) and asset developers, and meeting industrial standard requirements. AIoDP will allow the rapid prototyping of TAI applications and their deployment to a variety of cloud/edge/HPC infrastructures. To lower the entry barrier of using AI and to offer advanced AI capabilities, responsible European LLMs will be integrated in the AIoDP to enable services for downstream tasks, fine-tuning and other complex GPAI workflows. The AIoDP will be embedded in the European AI ecosystem, especially to EDIHs, TEFs, Dataspaces, SIMPL, and HPC/Cloud/Edge infrastructure. Interfaces to European initiatives and industrial AI- capable cloud platforms will be implemented, including an open API, to enable interoperability. A significant number of TAI resources will be made available on the AIoDP which will be qualified and labeled by an established process. Further, DeployAI will establish a viable AIoDP engagement strategy for AI resource providers and AI users and stimulate the European AI innovation landscape with its FSTP programme. Active stakeholder engagement will be ensured by providing matchmaking services and an interactive landscape tool. Finally, the project will provide a sustainable business model and a viable long-term strategy for the AIoDP. Governance structures responsible for the AIoDP ongoing operations will be put in place, while a permanent legal entity to own and operate the future AIoDP will be established.</p>

  <h1>FIWARE R &amp; D Projects: Enershare</h1>
  <p>
   Enershare facilitates the energy sovereign and trusted data exchange.
  </p>
  <h3 id="description">Description</h3> <p>The ongoing energy system digitisation is making available an enormous amount of data, paving the way for data sharing-enabled cross-value chain services, which may contribute to system-level increased efficiency and hence facilitate the energy transition. However data sharing in the energy sector is lagging behind, mainly due to lack of trust, privacy breaches risk and business models immaturity. In that respect Enershare will:</p> <ul> <li>Deliver a Reference Architecture for a European Energy Data Space, which hybridises SGAM with IDSA, FIWARE and GAIA-X architectures, by bringing data value chain perspective into the energy one.</li> <li>Evolve interoperability, trust, data value and governance building blocks to TRL 6-7 IDSA-compliant ones, adapt them to energy sector, and deploy:</li> </ul> <ol> <li>across-energy and cross-sector data enhancement technology enablers and standardisable interfaces and open APIs by leveraging on open Standards (e.g. ETSI Context Broker) and ontologies (e.g. SAREF)</li> <li>trust-related connectors, to ensure privacy, confidentiality, cybersecurity-preserving trust, sovereignty and full control of data</li> <li>Blockchain/Smart contract-enriched marketplace for data versus energy assets/services coordination, sharing, exchange, and beyond financial compensation</li> <li>cross-value chain value-added services and Digital Twins, by leveraging on privacy-preserving federated learning</li> </ol> <ul> <li>integrate and deploy them within a Reference Implementation of a European Energy Data Space, which will be demonstrated along 7 pilots and 11 intra-electricity, intra-energy and beyond energy use cases.</li> <li>co-design SSH-based consumer-centric business models for energy data sharing enabling data beyond-financial value creation and spreading along value chain d) prepare the ground for the European Energy Data Space setup, through alignment with EU-level relevant initiatives (GAIA-X, IDSA, BDVA, ETIP SNET, BRIDGE), contributing to Data Space standardisation and boosting a level playing field for data sharing.</li> </ul>

  <h1>FIWARE R &amp; D Projects: ARISE</h1>
  <p>
   Agile, human-centric and Real-time Open Source technologies, advancing industrial HRI in Europe.
  </p>
  <h3 id="objective">Objective</h3> <p>ARISE will make industrial HRI deployments simpler, cheaper, and more widespread in Europe by developing and demonstrating the concept of AgileHRI. The project envisions a near future which aligns with the principles of Industry 5.0, prioritizing resilient, sustainable, and human-centric work environments. In such a future, companies recognise that investing in industrial human-robot interaction (HRI) is essential for achieving better short- and long-term goals, rather than a cost.  Human-centric approaches surpass traditional technology-driven approaches, with technology serving people rather than the other way around. Industrial HRI establishes its position as a game-changing asset that enables seamless collaboration between humans and robots on complex tasks, allowing them to work together in shifts of any length.</p> <p>On its way to materialize such a vision, the ARISE project will </p> <ul> <li>address major application challenges from todayâ€™s industry, </li> <li>develop human-centric solutions, tools, and software modules which expand the state-of-the-art in industrial HRI, and </li> <li>deploy industrial HRI at scale in four testing and experimentation facilities and more than 25 workplaces across Europe (FSTP Projects). </li> </ul> <p>The ARISE project will address these challenges using cutting-edge open-source technologies from the European innovation ecosystem and will make a significant advance on their state-of-the-art to position Europe globally at the forefront of industrial HRI. To that aim, the project will put the focus on the achievement of four major goals: </p> <ul> <li>to increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of developing, deploying, and maintaining HRI solutions; </li> <li>To develop open-source based reusable modules which push industrial HRI beyond the SotA; </li> <li>to demonstrate openness and agility as crucial enablers of truly valuable and sustainable HRI solutions; </li> <li>to ensure impact a and sustainability through a critical mass of stakeholders &amp; strong liaisons with ADRA ecosystem.</li> </ul>

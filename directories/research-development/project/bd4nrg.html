  <h1>FIWARE R &amp; D Projects: BD4NRG</h1>
  <p>
   Big Data for Next Generation Energy. A reference architecture aligned with BDVA, SRIA, IDSA, FIWARE and SAREF standards.
  </p>
  <h3 id="objective">Objective</h3> <p>The rising decentralisation of the energy system is unveiling an enormous opportunity for energy stakeholders to leverage on big data &amp; AI technologies to improve decision making. There are however some barriers hampering the exploitation of this potential, such as the lack of standardised big data architectures for smart grids and regulatory frameworks not enabling data sharing.</p> <p>In that respect BD4NRG will i) deliver a reference architecture for Smart Energy, which aligns BDVA SRIA, IDSA and FIWARE architectures, SAREF standard and extend COSMAG specification to enable B2B multi-party data exchange, while providing full interoperability of leading-edge big data technologies with smart grid standards and operational frameworks ii) evolve and upscale a number of TRL 5-6 technology enablers, such as scalable sovereignty-preserving hybrid DLT/off-chain data governance, big data elastic pipeline orchestration, IoT/edge AI-based federated learning and multi-resource sharing tokenised marketplace, loosely integrate and deploy them within the TRL 7-8 BD4NRG framework iii) deliver a TRL8 open modular big data analytic toolbox as front-end for one-stop-shop analytics services development by orchestrating legacy and/or third party assets (data, computing resources, models, algorithms) iv) validate such framework through the delivery of predictive and prescriptive edge AI-based big data analytics on 13 large scale pilots, deployed by different energy stakeholders (TSOs and DSOs power network operators, aggregators, storage/renewable assets operators, local energy communities, ESCOs, power market operators, municipalities, financial institutions and ENTSO-E), fully covering the energy value chain v) setup a vibrant data-driven ecosystem through the SGBDAA Alliance, which will federate new energy data providers, attract SMEs for novel energy services provisioning through cascading funding and validate a hybrid energy/industry value chain supporting B2B joint digital platforms.</p>

	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</h1>
  <p>
   Rio de Janeiro, simply called Rio, is the second-most populous city in Brazil and the sixth-most populous in the Americas.
  </p>
  <p>Rio de Janeiro, simply called Rio, is the second-most populous city in Brazil and the sixth-most populous in the Americas. It is the capital of the state of the same name, Brazil’s third-most populous state. Some parts of the city have been designated as a World Heritage Site.</p> <p>Rio is famous for being one of the South- American economic centres and an international tourist destination. Thanks to its natural beauty, pleasant climate, famed carnival and plethora of attractions, Rio welcomes 2 to 3 million international tourists a year.</p> <p>In 2010, the landslide in Rio was a major social and environmental disaster, and the city had to take action. Spurred on by the forthcoming 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2016 Olympics, they developed an ambitious Operations Centre (COR). It’s a data hub sourced throughout Rio about factors such as traffic congestions and weather conditions, and it keeps government and citizens alike briefed with vital information. Their launched program “COR Challenge” is all about Smart City, an open innovation project, where academics, startups, and citizens create innovative solutions to solve the city’s most urgent problems.</p>

	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Posadas, Argentina</h1>
  <p>
   Posadas is the capital city of the province and is the administrative, commercial and cultural centre of the region in North East Argentina with a metropolitan population of 320,000 inhabitants.
  </p>
  <p>Posadas is the capital city of the province and is the administrative, commercial and cultural centre of the region in North East Argentina with a metropolitan population of 320,000 inhabitants. Impacting growth significantly in the entire Northeast region, it is consolidated as a centre of services (events and business tourism segment) and distribution for this region. This is possible thanks to its strategic location, its excellent connectivity, and because it holds one of the most important border crossings of the country, linking the cities of Posadas (Argentina) with Encarnación (Paraguay) through the International Bridge San Roque González de Santa Cruz. The city distributes visitor flows to the Iguazú Falls (Natural Wonder of the World) and the Iberá Wetlands.</p> <p>Its Smart City Strategy has been promoting a Smart Tourism development plan, proposing a new innovative model of tourism management (participatory and comprehensive), which involves a series of concrete actions in the territory, bringing benefits and improvements to both the tourists and the posadeños (citizens).</p>

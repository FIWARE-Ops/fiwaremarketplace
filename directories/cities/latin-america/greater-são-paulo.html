  <p>
   The Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, officially named Região Metropolitana de São Paulo (RMSP), consists of 39 municipalities with São Paulo, the capital of Brazil, among them.
  </p>
  <p>The Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, officially named Região Metropolitana de São Paulo (RMSP), consists of 39 municipalities with São Paulo, the capital of Brazil, among them. There are roughly 23,5 million people living in the area with 12,000,000 living in the capital itself. The area is an economic key driver in Brazil and the whole South-American continent. The city of São Paulo alone is responsible for about 10% of Brazil’s Gross Domestic Product and home to the São Paulo Stock Exchange.</p> <p>In 2017, the city published a “Smart City Master Plan”, which defined the new Smart City Strategy. This strategy sets focus on sustainable urban development and aims to increase and enhance public spaces and decrease the usage of cars.</p> <p>Urban mobility is a focus throughout the plan, which also addresses topics such as Smart Education, Smart Culture, Smart Health, Smart Housing, and Smart Environment.</p> <p>Among these topics, modern urban challenges like Water and Energy Management will play a key role in the development of São Paulo to become a truly smart region.</p>

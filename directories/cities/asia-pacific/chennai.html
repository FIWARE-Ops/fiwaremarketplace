	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Chennai, India</h1>
  <p>
   With its Smart Cities Mission, India started working on a strategy to revitalize its urban areas.
  </p>
  <p>With its <a href="https://www.india.gov.in/spotlight/smart-cities-mission-step-towards-smart-india">Smart Cities Mission</a>, India started working on a strategy to revitalize its urban areas. Led by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, the effort has been considerable, given the fact that India has 8,000+ towns and cities.</p> <p>The solution was to initially focus on 100+ cities, with Chennai among the cities shortlisted in India’s Smart Cities Mission.To successfully catapult the Mission to the next stage of innovation, India has launched several initiatives in the past years, including the <a href="https://iudx.org.in/">India Urban Data Exchange (IUDX)</a>, an Open Source platform that uses the FIWARE NGSI-LD specifications – to be rolled out to 100+ major cities between <a href="https://nudm.mohua.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IUDX-Booklet-FINAL.pdf">2021 and 2023</a>.</p> <p>Chennai, also known as Madras, is the largest cultural, economic and educational centre of South India. With a population of roughly 9 million inhabitants, the city of Chennai is the sixth largest city in India.</p> <p>Its Smart City Strategy aims to make the city greener through Smart Environment, Smart Mobility, Smart Transportation solutions as well as Smart Technologies, and more sustainable through Smart Energy and Smart Water strategies.</p>

	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Kohima, India</h1>
  <p>
   Kohima is the capital city of India’s north eastern state of Nagaland.
  </p>
  <p>Kohima is the capital city of India’s north eastern state of Nagaland. With a resident population of almost 100,000, it is the second largest city in the state. Originally known as Kewhira, Kohima was founded in 1878 when the British Empire established its headquarters in the then Naga Hills.</p> <p>It officially became the capital after the state of Nagaland was inaugurated in 1963. It has a very pleasant climate which is surrounded by scenic mountains ideal for tourists with all the major trekking destinations which are all easily accessible from Kohima. With its Smart Cities Mission, India started working on a strategy to revitalise its urban areas. Led by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, the effort has been considerable, given the fact that India has 8,000+ cities. The solution was to initially focus on 100+ cities, with Kohima among the cities shortlisted in India’s Smart Cities Mission.</p> <p>Kohima’s vision of a Smart City is “to leverage Kohima’s geo-strategic location to foster sustainable and resilient community-led development as a regional hub for tourism &amp; transit complemented by its significant natural and cultural assets”.</p>

	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Brisbane, Australia</h1>
  <p>
   Brisbane is the capital and most populous city of the Australian state of Queensland and the third-most populous city in Australia with a population of around 2,6 million inhabitants.
  </p>
  <p>Brisbane is the capital and most populous city of the Australian state of Queensland and the third-most populous city in Australia with a population of around 2,6 million inhabitants. It lies at the centre of the South East Queensland metropolitan region, which encompasses a population of around 3,8 million. Geographically, it is Australia’s largest metropolitan area.</p> <p>The city has strengths in technology, including mining research and green energy, medicine and biotechnology, digital industries, and robotics. Being a transport hub, Brisbane is served by large rail, bus and ferry networks, as well as Australia’s largest airport and third-largest seaport. The city will host the Olympic Games 2032.</p> <p>The Smart City Strategy aims to work with residents, businesses, universities and startups to explore how innovation, technology and data can help accelerate Brisbane’s progress towards achieving the broader city goals of liveability, sustainability and prosperity. This means the strategy isn’t driven by the latest technology, but rather by what will deliver a better Brisbane for residents, visitors, workers and businesses.</p>

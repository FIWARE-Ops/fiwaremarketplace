	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Sunshine Coast, Australia</h1>
  <p>
   Sunshine Coast is a peri-urban region in South East Queensland, Australia, with a population of 330,000 inhabitants.
  </p>
  <p>Sunshine Coast is a peri-urban region in South East Queensland, Australia, with a population of 330,000 inhabitants. It is located 100 km north of the centre of Brisbane in South East Queensland, on the Coral Sea coastline, and will be a co-host of the Olympic Games 2032. Its main economic drivers are Tourism and Agriculture. Sunshine Coast is worldwide known for its surf spots.</p> <p>The Smart City Program of the region enables Sunshine Coast Council to use technology to deliver services more efficiently and improve the lifestyle of residents while realising the vision to be Australia’s most sustainable region – healthy, smart, creative.</p> <p>In December 2016, Sunshine Coast Council adopted the Smart City Implementation Program (SCIP) to guide the deployment of Smart City solutions across the region in a staged manner. By using information and communications technology to connect people, processes, data and things, the city is able to improve quality of life, stimulate economic growth and ensure environmental sustainability throughout the region.</p>

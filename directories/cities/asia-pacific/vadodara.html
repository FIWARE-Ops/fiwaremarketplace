  </p>
  <p>With its ]Smart Cities Mission](https://www.india.gov.in/spotlight/smart-cities-mission-step-towards-smart-india), India started working on a strategy to revitalize its urban areas. Led by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, the effort has been considerable, given the fact that India has 8,000+ towns and cities.</p> <p>The solution was to initially focus on 100+ cities, with Vadodara among the cities shortlisted in India’s Smart Cities Mission.</p> <p>To successfully catapult the Mission to the next stage of innovation, India has launched several initiatives in the past years, including the ]India Urban Data Exchange (IUDX)](https://iudx.org.in/), an Open Source platform that uses the FIWARE NGSI-LD specifications – to be rolled out to 100+ major cities between <a href="https://nudm.mohua.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IUDX-Booklet-FINAL.pdf">2021 and 2023</a>.</p> <p>Vadodara, also known as Baroda, serves as the administrative headquarters of the Vadodara district. It is home to 3,500,000 inhabitants. The city is famous for its cultural heritage and its impressive landmarks. Vadodara’s Smart City Strategy aims for enhancing quality of life for the citizens by providing equal access to Best Quality Infrastructure, Social Infrastructure and Mobility through leveraging state of the art technology.</p>

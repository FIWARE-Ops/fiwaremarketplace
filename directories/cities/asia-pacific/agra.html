	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Agra, India</h1>
  <p>
   Agra is a city on the banks of the Yamuna river in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, about 210 kilometres south of the national capital New Delhi and 335 km west of the state capital Lucknow.
  </p>
  <p>Agra is a city on the banks of the Yamuna river in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, about 210 kilometres south of the national capital New Delhi and 335 km west of the state capital Lucknow. With a population of roughly 1,6 million, Agra is the fourth-most populous city in Uttar Pradesh and twentythird most populous city in India.</p> <p>Its notable historical period began during Sikandar Lodi’s reign, but the golden age of the city began with the Mughals. Agra was the foremost city of the Indian subcontinent and the capital of the Mughal Empire. Under Mughal rule, Agra became a centre for learning, arts, commerce, and religion, and saw the construction of the Agra Fort, Sikandra and Agra’s most prized monument, the Taj Mahal, built by Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his favourite empress.</p> <p>Due to its rich history, the city aims to develop the city further on and form a Smart City. The city’s Smart City vision is based on the aspirations of its people and the analytical assessment of strength, weaknesses, opportunities and threats for the city and aims to create a tourist-friendly, livable, and sustainable city for everyone.</p>

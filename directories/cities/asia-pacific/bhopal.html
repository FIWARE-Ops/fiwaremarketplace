	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Bhopal, India</h1>
  <p>
   With its Smart Cities Mission, India started working on a strategy to revitalize its urban areas.
  </p>
  <p>With its <a href="https://www.india.gov.in/spotlight/smart-cities-mission-step-towards-smart-india">Smart Cities Mission</a>, India started working on a strategy to revitalize its urban areas. Led by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, the effort has been considerable, given the fact that India has 8,000+ towns and cities.</p> <p>The solution was to initially focus on 100+ cities, with Bhopal among the cities shortlisted in India’s Smart Cities Mission.</p> <p>To successfully catapult the mission to the next stage of innovation, India has launched several initiatives in the past years, including the <a href="https://iudx.org.in/">India Urban Data Exchange (IUDX)</a>, an Open Source platform that uses the FIWARE NGSI-LD specifications – to be rolled out to 100+ major cities between <a href="https://nudm.mohua.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IUDX-Booklet-FINAL.pdf">2021 and 2023</a>.</p> <p>Bhopal is the capital city of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. It has a population of roughly 2 million inhabitants and considered to be one of India’s greenest cities.</p> <p>Its Smart City Strategy focusses on four different aspects: Transport and Mobility, Heritage and History, Solid Waste Management and Smart Health.</p>

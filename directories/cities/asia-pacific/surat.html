	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Surat, India</h1>
  <p>
   Similar to the other cities that make up the India Smart Cities initiative, Surat Smart City’s vision is to ensure its citizens benefit from improved quality of life, and the city does not fall short of smart innovative projects to deliver such a vision.
  </p>
  <p>Similar to the other cities that make up the <a href="https://nudm.mohua.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IUDX-Booklet-FINAL.pdf">India Smart Cities initiative</a>, Surat Smart City’s vision is to ensure its citizens benefit from improved quality of life, and the city does not fall short of smart innovative <a href="https://www.suratsmartcity.com/">projects</a> to deliver such a vision. Be it by providing fair access to both social physical infrastructure and improved mobility – through leveraging technology – the city envisions itself as a futuristic global city that fosters its economy, protects the environment and its identity and culture.</p> <p>With nearly eight million <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/varanasi-population">inhabitants</a>, Surat is one of the largest and fastest growing cities in the state of Gujarat. Ranked as the eighth-largest city and ninth largest urban agglomeration in India, it’s no wonder that improved mobility and infrastructure are a concern for the city representatives.</p> <p>In the pursuit of benefiting from the wider innovative and interoperable applications offered by the <a href="https://iudx.org.in/">IUDX</a> platform, the city is the latest to have deployed the Open Source software that uses the FIWARE NGSI-LD specifications.</p>

	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Agartala, India</h1>
  <p>
   With its Smart Cities Mission, India started working on a strategy to revitalize its urban areas.
  </p>
  <p>With its <a href="https://www.india.gov.in/spotlight/smart-cities-mission-step-towards-smart-india">Smart Cities Mission</a>, India started working on a strategy to revitalize its urban areas. Led by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, the effort has been considerable, given the fact that India has 8,000+ towns and cities.</p> <p>The solution was to initially focus on major 100+ cities, with Agartala among the cities shortlisted in India’s Smart Cities Mission.</p> <p>To successfully catapult the mission to the next stage of innovation, India launched several initiatives in the past years, including the <a href="https://iudx.org.in/">India Urban Data Exchange (IUDX)</a>, an Open Source platform that uses the FIWARE NGSI-LD specifications – to be rolled out to 100+ major cities between <a href="https://nudm.mohua.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IUDX-Booklet-FINAL.pdf">2021 and 2023</a>.</p> <p>Agartala is the capital city of the Indian state of Tripura, and is one of the largest cities in Northeast India and the seat of the Government of Tripura. Agartala is India’s third international internet gateway after the ones in Mumbai and Chennai.</p> <p>Its Smart City projects focus on an Integrated Control and Command Center and a Vehicular Monitoring System.</p>

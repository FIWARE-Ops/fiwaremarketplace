	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Bhubaneswar, India</h1>
  <p>
   With its Smart Cities Mission, India started working on a strategy to revitalize its urban areas.
  </p>
  <p>With its <a href="https://www.india.gov.in/spotlight/smart-cities-mission-step-towards-smart-india">Smart Cities Mission</a>, India started working on a strategy to revitalize its urban areas. Led by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, the effort has been considerable, given the fact that India has 8,000+ towns and cities.</p> <p>The solution was to initially focus on 100+ cities, with Bhubaneswar among the cities shortlisted in India’s Smart Cities Mission. To successfully catapult the mission to the next stage of innovation, India has launched several initiatives in the past years, including the <a href="https://iudx.org.in/">India Urban Data Exchange (IUDX)</a>, an Open Source platform that uses the FIWARE NGSI-LD specifications – to be rolled out to 100+ major cities between <a href="https://nudm.mohua.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/IUDX-Booklet-FINAL.pdf">2021 and 2023</a>.</p> <p>Bhubaneswar or Bhubaneshwar is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Odisha. It has a population of roughly 840,000 inhabitants. Because of the more than 700 temples that used to stand here, the city is often referred to as “Temple City”.</p> <p>Its Smart City Strategy aims for more through less resources and aims for a citizen centered, more sustainable city impacting diverse parts of the citizen’s life.</p>

	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Jaipur, India</h1>
  <p>
   Jaipur, formerly Jeypore, is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Rajasthan.
  </p>
  <p>Jaipur, formerly Jeypore, is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Rajasthan. As of 2011, the city had a population of 3,1 million, making it the tenth most populous city in the country. Jaipur is also known as the Pink City, due to the dominant colour scheme of its buildings. It is also known as the Paris of India. After independence in 1947, Jaipur was made the capital of the newly formed state of Rajasthan.</p> <p>Jaipur is a popular tourist destination in India and forms a part of the Golden Triangle tourist circuit along with Delhi and Agra. On 6 July 2019, UNESCO World Heritage Committee inscribed Jaipur the “Pink City of India” among its World Heritage Sites. The city is also home to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites Amer Fort and Jantar Mantar.</p> <p>The Smart City strategy of Jaipur aspires to leverage its heritage and tourism, through innovative and inclusive solutions, to enhance the quality of life. To do so the city has started several projects and platform implementations in the areas of Air Quality Monitoring, online citizen services and Open Data Portals.</p>

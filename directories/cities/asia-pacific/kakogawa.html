   Kakogawa is a city located in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan, with roughly 266,500 inhabitants (as of 2016), and well known for its cultural and culinary heritage.
  </p>
  <p>Kakogawa is a city located in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan, with roughly 266,500 inhabitants (as of 2016), and well known for its cultural and culinary heritage.</p> <p>The city is part of the Western Japanese railway system and therefore well connected to other important cities like Osaka and Kobe.</p> <p>The city faces high crime rates, which determines the Smart City Strategy of the city’s government. The strategy tries to deter terrorism and crime while protecting the citizens, making the city more enjoyable and thereby increasing its attractiveness also for tourists. The second part of the strategy aims to respond to the increase in disasters associated with climate change.</p> <p>The city tackles these challenges with detection, prediction and advanced analytics of Big Data collected by sensors throughout the whole city. The analyzed and anonymous data is used to identify potential dangerous and disaster situations and and inform citizens through push-type notifications when it comes to warnings or evacuations.</p>

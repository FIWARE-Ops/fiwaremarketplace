	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Takamatsu, Japan</h1>
  <p>
   Takamatsu is a city that has been actively promoting its Smart City policy.
  </p>
  <p>Takamatsu is a city that has been actively promoting its Smart City policy.</p> <p>Setting the target to become “a city of sustainable growth”, it aims to meet specific regional challenges and stimulate regional economic growth through digital innovation. It does this through the collection, sharing, and re-use of a wide range of IoT data. For instance, one of the first-year initiatives promoted by the city is its disaster resilience initiative.</p> <p>It, hereby, works toward maintaining a safe and secure community for its citizens by working on a real-time understanding of risky situations, thereby accommodating early and appropriate evacuation plans for citizens.</p> <p>In 2018, Takamatsu adopted FIWARE to move their vision for a smarter city forward under the framework of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications project, which highlights cross-segment utilization of data to deliver truly smart services.</p>

	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Langenfeld, Germany</h1>
  <p>
   The German city of Langenfeld with its approximately 60,000 inhabitants is located in North Rhine-Westphalia near Dusseldorf, and provides a rich shopping experience for the region’s citizens.
  </p>
  <p>The German city of Langenfeld with its approximately 60,000 inhabitants is located in North Rhine-Westphalia near Dusseldorf, and provides a rich shopping experience for the region’s citizens. In order to meet the requirements of digitization, the communal company, ‘’Digital- und Infrastrukturgesellschaft Langenfeld’’ (DIL), was founded solely for this purpose. Its scope was to optimise and renew the lighting infrastructure, and thus achieve the sustainable development of a digital infrastructure. The DIL’s role also covers topics of sensor technology, Smart City, digital administration, and digital schools.</p> <p>DIL is intended to secure the digital supply for citizens in the same way as, for example, the waterworks or power plants ensure it for their supply products. This holistic approach builds on the secure and long-term provision of necessary infrastructure, which today includes digital infrastructure in particular, as it is also existential for all providers of urban infrastructure involved.</p> <p>Another important task of the DIL is to increase the attractiveness of the inner city and improve the safety of the city’s recreational parks.</p>

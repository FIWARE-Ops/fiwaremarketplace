	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Etteln, Germany</h1>
  <p>
   Etteln is a village of 1,850 inhabitants and part of the municipality of Borchen close to Paderborn in Germany.
  </p>
  <p>Etteln is a village of 1,850 inhabitants and part of the municipality of Borchen close to Paderborn in Germany. The village has a long-lasting history of its people voluntarily taking care of its infrastructure and environment.</p> <p>Starting in 2018, this engagement was slowly transferred from analog to digital work. It started with a future conference on digitization in rural areas and was followed in early 2020 by providing the digital infrastructure for future applications. Within the village centre the company Deutsche Glasfaser provided ‘fibre to the home’ but there was no incentive for them to provide anything outside the village centre. The people in the village worked together to deploy another 30 kilometres of fibre and connected 47 houses and farms outside of the village centre to the network. 60 people voluntarily spent 3,500 hours completing this project and finished it within six months.</p> <p>The basis for the digital future of the village was prepared.</p>

	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Berlin, Germany</h1>
  <p>
   Berlin is the capital and biggest city in Germany, and home to 3,5 million inhabitants.
  </p>
  <p>Berlin is the capital and biggest city in Germany, and home to 3,5 million inhabitants. The city has been growing for years. In 2030, at least 250,000 more people will live in the city than today. This means that the demand for housing is constantly growing, as are the requirements for mobility, infrastructure adjustments, and available resources such as water, energy, data and cultivatable surface. Like many metropolises around the world, Berlin is facing various challenges now and in the future.</p> <p>The Smart City approach aims to use intelligent technology to find solutions for Berlin’s ecological, social, economic and cultural challenges. Berlin aims to preserve and, if possible, enhance its attractiveness and quality of life.</p> <p>The “Berlin Strategy Urban Development Concept Berlin 2030” follows a clearly formulated mission statement. The Smart City Strategy Berlin makes part of a framework describing a political-strategic innovation approach. This approach expands and secures the future viability of Berlin in a way that is oriented towards the common good.</p>

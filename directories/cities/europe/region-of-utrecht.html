	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Region of Utrecht, Netherlands</h1>
  <p>
   By 2030, more than 80% of the Dutch population will live in urban areas.
  </p>
  <p>By 2030, more than 80% of the Dutch population will live in urban areas.</p> <p>The development and maintenance of a healthy living environment are therefore of crucial importance for the health and wellbeing of the people.</p> <p>One specific area that impacts healthy urban living is mobility and air quality. Although people in The Netherlands cycle a lot, there is a shortage in valuable and usable data about cycling compared to car traffic. As a result, cycling is often underexposed in mobility policies.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.utrechtregion.com/">Utrecht Region</a> wants to be a leader with regards to cycle knowledge, data, and tools. Its strategy is about “Healthy Urban Living” and it contributes to that with various FIWARE-related projects, also including EV-charging stations (charging station data and parking sensors to provide better information about usage), the IRISproject (energy transition) and their open data portal.</p>

	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Paderborn, Germany</h1>
  <p>
   Located in North Rhine-Westphalia and with more than 150,000 inhabitants, Paderborn has high ambitions with regards to digitalization.
  </p>
  <p>Located in North Rhine-Westphalia and with more than 150,000 inhabitants, Paderborn has high ambitions with regards to digitalization. In contrast to its ancient history, the city breathes modernity and digital innovation. As one of the most important centers of the computer science industry in Germany, the city is home to many leading IT companies. Due to this, Paderborn’s university also focuses on technological research, being referred to as “University of the information society”.</p> <p>With the aim of building a digital ecosystem for its local economy, Paderborn is currently developing a central open data platform, funded by the state of North Rhine- Westphalia, as part of its funding program to get its regions on the digital path.</p> <p>Being a FIWARE Foundation member, Paderborn lays the cornerstone of an innovative Smart City architecture for open data, from which other cities already benefit, on a license-charge-free basis. The documentation and Open Data Platform elements can be found on <a href="https://gitlab.com/zentrale-open-data-plattform-paderborn">Github</a>.</p>

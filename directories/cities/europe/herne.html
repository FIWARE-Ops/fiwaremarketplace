  <p>Urban, digital, and international. The city of Herne is taking big steps forward towards its digital transformation. Where coal and steel once resulted in Germany’s economic boom, the focus has shifted to a greener, resilient, sustainable urban development, both social and economic.</p> <p>Digitalization holds great potential for Herne, which is located in the heart of the Ruhr region.</p> <p>Much attention has therefore been put on, for instance, new ways of communication, both socially and professionally, to bring about new educational opportunities for lifelong learning and individual support. Digital education is one of the pillars of a digital sovereign society. In turn, there are also economic benefits such as new events (like <a href="http://digital.herne.business/">Digital.Herne.Business</a>), innovative and data-driven urban development, business models, and higher productivity.</p> <p>All these factors have already begun to accelerate the city and region’s added value in its modernization process.</p>

	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Perugia, Italy</h1>
  <p>
   The city of Perugia is the main urban centre of central Italy and capital of the Umbria region.
  </p>
  <p>The city of Perugia is the main urban centre of central Italy and capital of the Umbria region. Perugia has a population of around 165,000 inhabitants, a municipal area that extends for about 449 km² with a population density of 363.32 inhabitants / km². A vast territory that requires maximum efficiency in the provision of urban services to citizens and a continuous construction of communication channels between decision-makers and citizens. The city has an important tourist flow and welcomes a large number of students from all over the country, thanks to the quality of its university institutes.</p> <p>To face the needs of the city, the municipality has developed a smart city transformation strategy – called Agenda Urbana – with the goal of improving services and the lives of citizens. The project strategy is based on the value of city data, so the main improvement concerns the data collection and management system; moreover, the smart city transformation process requires the integration of IoT services and technologies, a Decision Support System and other tools to promote the active participation of citizens.</p>

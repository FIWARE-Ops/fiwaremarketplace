	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Vers-Pont-du-Gard, France</h1>
  <p>
   Vers – Pont-du-Gard is a town in the Gard department in Southern France with roughly 10,000 inhabitants.
  </p>
  <p>Vers – Pont-du-Gard is a town in the Gard department in Southern France with roughly 10,000 inhabitants.</p> <p>The ancient, Roman aqueduct bridge “Pont-Du-Gard” was built in the first century AD to carry water over 50 km to the Roman colony of Nemausus. It crosses the river Gardon near the town. The Pont-du-Gard is the highest of all Roman aqueduct bridges existing, as well as one of the best preserved. It was added to UNESCO’s list of World Heritage Sites in 1985 because of its historical importance. The aqueduct has been a famous tourist attraction for many years and is with more than 1,500,000 visitors per year one of the five most visited tourist attractions in France.</p> <p>To manage these high numbers of tourists, the governance of the small town decided for a digitalization of the touristic management system in order to improve the visitor’s experiences. This digital transformation process is led by the FIWARE member Snap4City.</p>

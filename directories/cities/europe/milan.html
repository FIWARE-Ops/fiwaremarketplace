  </p>
  <p>The city of Milan, located in Northern Italy, is the capital of the Lombardy Region and the second largest city in Italy. It has a territory of around 182 km2 and almost 1.4 million inhabitants. It is also located at the centre of an even larger metropolitan area, estimated to be the largest in Italy and one of the largest in the EU.Milan is one of the worldâ€™s most important commercial and financial hubs.</p> <p>For Milan, a smart city must not be technology-driven only, but also centred on its citizens. The Milan Smart City comprises smart mobility, a smart environment, smart Inclusion, and smart citizenship. This bold agenda includes the re-orientation of demand for transport services, the standardisation of payment technologies and methods, and the adoption of a range of energy-efficient solutions.</p> <p>Internationally, Milan has an active role in five major global and European urban networks: C40, 100 Resilient Cities, the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate &amp; Energy, Eurocities, the Climate KIC and the Urban Mobility KIC.</p>

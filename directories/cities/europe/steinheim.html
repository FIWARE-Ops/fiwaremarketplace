	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Steinheim, Germany</h1>
  <p>
   The small town of Steinheim Westphalia is a city in the German state of North Rhine- Westphalia and belongs to the district of Höxter.
  </p>
  <p>The small town of Steinheim Westphalia is a city in the German state of North Rhine- Westphalia and belongs to the district of Höxter. Steinheim is located in the region of East Westphalia-Lippe, in which the three major cities, Bielefeld, Paderborn, and Gütersloh are located. Overall, the region around Steinheim is very rural and is characterised by a lot of agriculture and natural areas. With about 13,000 inhabitants and a population density of about 166 people per square kilometre, Steinheim is the most densely populated municipality in the district of Höxter after the city of Höxter itself. It is also an important, central point for the surrounding communities and villages.</p> <p>The most important waterway in the area is the Emmer River, which is dammed in the city of Schieder to form a natural reservoir, called Schiederstausee. Unfortunately, Steinheim is particularly affected by flood events. Both the Emmer River, which runs right through the centre of town, and many smaller inflows, such as the Heubach River, have been known to flood. For this reason, an area-wide sensor network was installed along the Emmer and Heubach River to monitor the water levels.</p>

	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Lübeck, Germany</h1>
  <p>
   Lübeck is a city in Northern Germany, located at the Baltic Sea.
  </p>
  <p>Lübeck is a city in Northern Germany, located at the Baltic Sea. Its 220,000 inhabitants make the city the second biggest city on Germany’s baltic coast. It is famous for its UNESCO World Heritage old town.</p> <p>The Smart City strategy aims to create an intelligently connected city that prioritises the needs of people, but balances them with nature and the environment. It is both technologically advanced, efficient and competitive, as well as resource-conserving, nature-oriented and social. This combination is what makes a Smart City so livable.</p> <p>The first participatory approaches to urban development serve as a starting point for developing a strategy together with the city’s residents. In doing so, the experience at the universities, research and transfer institutions will be used. In this way, a direct, lively exchange between the knowledge carriers at the universities and civil society is created, e.g. through new cooperation concepts such as Campus Lübeck, co-working spaces, innovation hubs and much more.</p>

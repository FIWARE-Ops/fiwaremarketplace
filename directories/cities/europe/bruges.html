The city’s historic centre, a UNESCO World Heritage site, boasts numerous landmarks such as the Belfry of Bruges, the Basilica of the Holy Blood, and various churches and mediaeval buildings.</p> <p>Known as the Venice of the North, Bruges is loved for its many canals and unquestionable, authentic charm.</p> <p>The city has taken several initiatives and implemented smart city strategies, such as smart parking sensors, crowd flow monitoring, water level monitors, and air quality sensors, to improve the quality of life of its citizens and enhance sustainability.

	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: La Réunion, France</h1>
  <p>
   La Réunion or Réunion is an island in the Indian Ocean is an overseas department of France.
  </p>
  <p>La Réunion or Réunion is an island in the Indian Ocean is an overseas department of France. It is located approximately 500 km east of the island of Madagascar. As of January 2021, it had a population of 858,450.</p> <p>Like the other four overseas departments, Réunion also holds the status of a region of France, and is an integral part of the French Republic. Réunion is an outermost region of the European Union and is part of the Eurozone.</p> <p>The economic driver of the region is tourism followed by the production of agricultural goods.</p> <p>Due to the economic performance heavily relying on the environment, the island’s government decided to make the Smart Island Strategy aiming for an ecological and industrial transformation of both the touristic and the agricultural sector. To do so, the city rolled out a pilot project in the community of La Possession and opened a tender for developing a Smart Island Platform for both ecological and industrial transformation.</p> <p>The tender was won by FIWARE Member Eridanis who is in 2021 developing the digital transformation platform.</p>

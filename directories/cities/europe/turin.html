	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Turin, Italy</h1>
  <p>
   Turin is an important cultural and business center in the North of Italy and capital of the region Piedmont.
  </p>
  <p>Turin is an important cultural and business center in the North of Italy and capital of the region Piedmont. The metropolitan area is home to 2,2 million inhabitants of which 850,000 are living in the city.</p> <p>Making urban spaces more liveable and safer during the night is a major issue for the city of Turin and its residents. During the day, services and economic activities provide citizens with a feeling of security. During the night, these activities are considerably reduced, so the task of protecting the public falls heavily on the local authorities.</p> <p>In addition, Turin is facing rapid social change that puts increased pressure on its public spaces at night, including changes in the population mix, urban lifestyles, and worsening of the socio-economic conditions. The <a href="https://tonite.eu/">ToNite</a> project allows the city to face the challenge by implementing multidisciplinary solutions which help both local authorities and citizens understand the evolving demands of public spaces at night.</p>

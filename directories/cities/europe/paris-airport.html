  <p>
   Paris isn’t just the capital of France, it is also recognized as the global epicentre of arts and architecture.
  </p>
  <p>Paris isn’t just the capital of France, it is also recognized as the global epicentre of arts and architecture. With a population of over 2 million people, the city is home to iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Champs Elysees and Arc de Triomphe, making it one of the world’s top tourist destinations. Located in the northern central part of France, Paris is spread across both banks of the Seine River.</p> <p>It also holds the title of the most-visited city worldwide, with 44 million tourists in 2022. This means that the city and its airports need to aim for optimal business logistics management and a greener way to support their activities. In 2021, the Charles de Gaulle airport initiated the OLGA Project to reduce Groupe ADP’s environmental impact, this project aims to improve the aviation sector’s environmental impact in an innovative and sustainable way. With Zagreb Airport in Croatia as a partner, the new strategic project focuses on innovative measures to reduce CO2 emissions, improve air quality, and preserve biodiversity. The results are expected to generate positive environmental and economic impacts that will spread to the local, national, and European levels.</p>

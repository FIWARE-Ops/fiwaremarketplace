  </p>
  <p>Noisy-le-Grand is a small city in the suburbs of France’s capital Paris and home to roughly 70,000 inhabitants. It is located 15 kilometers East of the city center of Paris. Due to its good connection to the city via train, Noisy-le-Grand is popular to commuters to and from Paris.</p> <p>The Smart City Strategy of the city is conceptualized around a Smart Data approach. This includes a global database in order to ensure data interoperability of various digital services of the city. Moreover, the strategy aims to develop tools using artificial intelligence to help to improve Smart Mobility, Smart Health and Smart Environment solutions. All of the gathered data is supposed to be collected, analyzed and made available in an Open Data Portal.</p> <p>Noisy-le-Grand will thus be more transparent for the inhabitants of the city. They will also be able to benefit from a better quality of services thanks to the information shared by the city’s digital services. This way, the city’s government wants to ensure that all citizens benefit from the digital transformation of the city.</p>

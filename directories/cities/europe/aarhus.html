  </p>
  <p>Aarhus is located on the east coast of Jutland, in the central part of Denmark. It is the second-largest city in the country, and has a population of approximately 350,000 people. It is often considered the cultural capital of Denmark for its vibrant arts scene and numerous cultural events throughout the year. Originally called Aros, the city has a rich history that dates back to the Viking Age. Aros is also the name of the city’s art museum where you can take a walk in the famous infinite rainbow on top of the building. Next to the art museum you will find the half of the city that was designed by the world-famous architect Arne Jacobsen in the 1930’s.</p> <p>Aarhus is committed to becoming a Smart City. Its Smart City Strategy focuses on using technology and innovation to improve green transition, sustainability, mobility, and quality of life for its residents. The strategy includes initiatives such as smart mobility solutions, energy-efficient buildings, and digital solutions for citizen engagement. Aarhus is a city that offers a unique blend of ancient history and modern innovation, and this commitment ensures that it will continue to be a leader in urban development and sustainability for years to come.</p>

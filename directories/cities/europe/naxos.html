	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Naxos, Greece</h1>
  <p>
   The island of Naxos is the largest in the Cyclades island complex.
  </p>
  <p>The island of Naxos is the largest in the Cyclades island complex. It is home to 22,000 year-round residents and welcomes more than 130,000 tourists during the summer.</p> <p>The island experiences many of the challenges faced by other Greek islands. The limited transportation options to Chora, the island’s main settlement, presents problems such as limited access to health services. Additionally, the island’s other infrastructure, like its road network, local marina, parking lots, water supply, waste management, and power generation, can struggle to meet demands, especially during the summer. The geography of Naxos and Small Cyclades — a cluster of four small islands — is the ideal location for experimenting with technological solutions that entail transferring goods over the sea.</p> <p>Greece has set ambitious targets and is moving fast with its digital transformation. With projects such as Smart Island, AWS seeks to be part of the major effort that is underway, providing tools and solutions for the digital transformation of the state, its cities, and its enterprises both large and small in the years to come.</p>

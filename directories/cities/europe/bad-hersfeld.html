	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Bad Hersfeld, Germany</h1>
  <p>
   The festival city of Bad Hersfeld, located in the centre of Germany, with its approximately 30,000 citizens belongs to the state of Hesse and, due to its central location, has a high significance for logistics companies and, as a result, a high volume of traffic, especially from trucks and the associated noise and exhaust emissions.
  </p>
  <p>The festival city of Bad Hersfeld, located in the centre of Germany, with its approximately 30,000 citizens belongs to the state of Hesse and, due to its central location, has a high significance for logistics companies and, as a result, a high volume of traffic, especially from trucks and the associated noise and exhaust emissions.</p> <p>The city of Bad Hersfeld would like to counteract this burden on citizens and has initiated optimization measures by means of a digitization strategy. To obtain a concrete situation report, a central data platform was set up to collect and analyse all existing and new urban data and make it available for further use and measures.</p> <p>For example, parking systems in the city were made smart and connected and information about free parking spaces, especially in the inner city and commuter parking lots, was collected and made publicly available. Furthermore, noise sensors were installed along a highway, the information from which was also evaluated and gave rise to the introduction of speed reduction through speed limits. Other innovative digitization approaches are currently being implemented or are at the planning stage.</p>

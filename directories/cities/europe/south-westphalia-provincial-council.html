	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: South Westphalia Provincial Council, Germany</h1>
  <p>
   South Westphalia is the industrial heart of North Rhine-Westphalia.
  </p>
  <p>South Westphalia is the industrial heart of North Rhine-Westphalia.</p> <p>The region consists of the five districts of Soest, Olpe, Siegen-Wittgenstein, Märkischer Kreis and Hochsauerlandkreis, with over 1,4 million inhabitants spanning over 900 villages in 59 municipalities. Within the region, a cooperation of the cities Arnsberg, Bad Berleburg, Menden, Olpe and Soest along with the Südwestfalen Agentur anticipates implementing the region’s first Smart Cities in a pilot project promoted by the Federal Ministry for Housing, Urban Development and Building.</p> <p>In 2020, the cooperation published the “Smart Cities Framework Strategy for South Westphalia”, a brief document in which the five cities define the term and its objectives valid for a whole region. Among several measures, the cities committed on creating a shared open data platform to unite work forces and to prevent isolation of key technologies. Setting common grounds enables the whole region to contribute to innovation and to benefit from an opensource use case pool. The project pays special attention to enabling benefits also in rural areas which face different challenges than urban centres.</p>

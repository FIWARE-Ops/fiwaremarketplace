	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Leuven, Belgium</h1>
  <p>
   Leuven is the capital of the province of Flemish Brabant in the Flemish Region of Belgium.
  </p>
  <p>Leuven is the capital of the province of Flemish Brabant in the Flemish Region of Belgium. It is home to 100,000 inhabitants and hosts over 60,000 students at KU Leuven, one of the oldest universities of North-West Europe.</p> <p>Leuven has committed to becoming a climate neutral city by 2030 and formed a cooperation model with citizens, companies, and research institutes through the NGO [‘Leuven 2030’](http://leuven 2030/). Leuven is running several projects in fields like energy, food consumption, and mobility, to contribute to a sustainable and climate-neutral future.</p> <p>Because of its efforts and inclusive approach, Leuven was recognized as the European Capital of Innovation in 2020 and is one of the cities in the ‘100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities by 2030’ mission. It also received the 2018 European Green Leaf award. Sustainable food consumption and agriculture are top priorities in the city’s policymaking.</p> <p>Leuven’s local food strategy involves over 100 stakeholders. It aims to help local companies reach their potential in sustainable food production and reduce food waste at every step in the food production chain. Booming urban logistics is also a big challenge for transporters and merchants.</p> <p>Overcoming this challenge requires rethinking regulation in the city and smart use of technology to understand the city’s logistics and promote sustainable mobility.</p>

	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Arezzo, Italy</h1>
  <p>
   Arezzo is located in the region of Tuscany and home to 99,000 inhabitants.
  </p>
  <p>Arezzo is located in the region of Tuscany and home to 99,000 inhabitants. Besides its ancient history which dates back to the fourth century BC, Arezzo aims to become a smarter and more sustainable city nowadays.</p> <p>Finding the right parking slot in the shortest time period possible represents an issue for all cities around the world.</p> <p>Indeed, not finding the right parking slot at the right moment means a waste of valuable citizens’ time, an increase in the level of citizens’ stress, a loss in the city’s economic performance, and a consequent increase of both CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>In addition, there is also an increase in potential car crashes caused by the abundance of vehicles moving around disorganized parking lots. To address all these challenges in a smart way while providing an efficient and effective service to their citizens or visitors, Arezzo has decided to implement a smart parking platform.</p>

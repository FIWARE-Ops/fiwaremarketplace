	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Vienna, Austria</h1>
  <p>
   Vienna is known for being one of the world’s smartest cities.
  </p>
  <p>Vienna is known for being one of the world’s smartest cities. Aiming to have all their citizens benefiting from digital transformation, Austria’s capital has been building its “Smart City Strategy” since 2014 and is consistently implementing it.</p> <p>This city is one of the pioneers in projects that use digital technologies to optimize various areas such as mobility, environment, e-health, etc.</p> <p>Vienna is also the first German-speaking city to have launched Open Government Data – an open and transparent system that makes city data available to the public for their further use.</p> <p>In addition, the city has introduced a standardized monitoring system for all of its smart city projects. Everything is coordinated by the central Smart City Agency, a unit that pools technical expertise and promotes links between the city administration, research, business, and industry.</p>

	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Eindhoven, Netherlands</h1>
  <p>
   Eindhoven aims to create a ‘smart society’ and it hereby views citizens as key players in addressing challenges and problems.
  </p>
  <p>Eindhoven aims to create a ‘smart society’ and it hereby views citizens as key players in addressing challenges and problems. The city is, therefore, human-driven, supported by technology and design.</p> <p>To realize its vision of being a truly smart society, the city council set up the Smart Society Programme, which focuses on the areas of data infrastructure, living labs, community, and ecosystem.</p> <p>Social issues are hereby collected from the bottom up, giving citizens the freedom to express their worries, needs, and frustrations, and shared with potential partners, experts and designers.</p> <p>The city collects and analyses data on mobility, environment, energy, and public safety. Not only can this improve city management and services, but it also opens up the potential for interested parties to build innovative solutions for societal challenges, based on data.</p>

	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Brussels, Belgium</h1>
  <p>
   Brussels is not only considered the de facto capital of the European Union, but also Belgium’s capital and the heart of the Brussels Capital Region including 18 municipalities located around the city.
  </p>
  <p>Brussels is not only considered the de facto capital of the European Union, but also Belgium’s capital and the heart of the Brussels Capital Region including 18 municipalities located around the city.</p> <p>The region is one of three federal states in Belgium. As of 2021, more than 2,1 million people were living in the Brussels Capital Region.</p> <p>Moreover, Brussels is home to the most important institutions of the European Union; among them the European Commission and the European Parliament.</p> <p>With the ambition to become a smart city, Brussels is increasingly presenting new ideas and projects to achieve this.</p> <p>The primary goal is to improve the quality of life of everyone – citizens, visitors, commuters, and businesses. The city pursues its own smart city strategy under the name <a href="https://smartcity.brussels/">smartcity.brussels</a>, which is the backbone of Brussels digital strategy. The Brussels-Capital Region’s definition of the Smart City is “a city which uses smart solutions, based on data and certain technologies, which can lead to improved quality of life in a region”.</p>

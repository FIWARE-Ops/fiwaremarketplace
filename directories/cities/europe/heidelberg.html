	<h1>FIWARE Smart Cities: Heidelberg, Germany</h1>
  <p>
   With a population of around 160,000 citizens, the city of Heidelberg is the fifth largest city in Baden-Württemberg (Germany).
  </p>
  <p>With a population of around 160,000 citizens, the city of Heidelberg is the fifth largest city in Baden-Württemberg (Germany). Amid the Rhine-Neckar metropolitan region, the city on the river Neckar is considered one of the most livable cities in Germany due to its cultural charm, favourable climatic conditions, and urban flair.</p> <p>In addition to its tourist attractions, such as the old town and the castle ruins, the city is known for its venerable university dating back to the 14th century, as well as for many other universities and internationally renowned research institutions.</p> <p>Nevertheless, there are challenges for the city of science and culture, especially in the areas of Smart Environment, Smart Mobility, and Smart Citizens that also includes E-Government as well as participation topics. For example, the topological location of the city on the river Neckar, with its different locations of educational and research institutions, a high commuter rate of working people as well as the pronounced tourism, creates a diverse mobility volume. For the modern and digitally shaped city, this also means dealing intensively with digital solution approaches to maintain and accentuate public services and foster the quality of life on a local/communal and regional level.</p>

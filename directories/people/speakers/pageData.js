During his 3 ½ years there, James has spent most of his time with the corporate community, discussing their aspirations and helping them to understand how they turn their circular economic journey into a reality. As the world continues to grapple to create both impact and growth, James works with leading brands and anyone who will listen, on how they can start that journey. James spends most of his time speaking to people and telling them stories. He tries to help organizations not only to find their “why”, be that economic, social, or environmental, but more importantly help them take the first steps to create systems that are both purposeful but also profitable. The evolution of this journey has now led him to Pyxera Global. Having worked with the team for a couple of years, it was a natural step for him to broaden his economic focus to include the key elements of social and environmental justice.

            <p>The energy sector has an increasing need for flexibility, including flexibility in the era of digitalisation. This can only be built by leveraging on a cloud-based, service-oriented open source software platform – based on open source technologies – in order to facilitate an efficient, automated and sustainable energy supply for businesses and municipalities.</p>

            <h3 class="card-journey-title">Digital Twins and the role of the Energy Orchestrator</h3>
            <p>The need of an Energy Orchestrator that manages data, holds Digital Twins of connected units, performs forecasts of consumption, production and available flexibility and storage capacity, is at the center of this model of democratization of energy, where businesses, communities and, at the very end, citizens become actors in the energy market.</p>

            <h3 class="card-journey-title">Empowering the Energy Transition</h3>
            <p>The Energy transition leads to a situation where the main activities in electricity happens at the edge of the grid, with decentralised small-scale production, but also flexibility in terms of demand response and storage capacity. This means that the current setup to orchestrate energy mainly at TSO level but also at DSO level needs to change - and also to be distributed. A local Energy Community can do the orchestration within its local environment, exchange surplus, deficits and flexibility with other neighbouring communities.</p>

            <h3 class="card-journey-title">Green Evolution for All</h3>
            <p>In the Energy Community, everyone, meaning any owner of an energy device, may it be big or small, participates on an equal basis to the system orchestrating the production and consumption of electricity. These local communities can be the solution, the missing link, to enable the energy transition and provide the foundation to deliver on the commitments, e.g. on green targets defined by the European Commission for 2030 and 2050.</p>

            <h3 class="card-journey-title">Data Spaces</h3>
            <p>The energy transition requires a new approach to the way we treat information, aggregate and process real-time data, in order to assure the balancing of the energy systems during fluctuation of renewable energy production cycles. To facilitate data sharing and exchange that is scalable, secure, and grants data sovereignty to data owners and providers, new digital business models have been established with the help of data spaces, allowing each business player involved in a data sharing and exchange transaction to leverage the full value of their data.</p>

            <p>The role for the Energy Orchestrator provides the possibility to directly interface the power grid (distribution grid) where the energy imbalances are settled in delivery time (real-time). Provided that Energy Communities have a certain flexibility, they can help the grid in terms of voltage control (consider reactive power and voltage) and frequency control (consider active power and frequency), enabling new economic actors (businesses, communities and citizens) to play their role in this complex and distributed architecture.</p>

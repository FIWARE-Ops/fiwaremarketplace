            <p>Based on Open Standards and designed to support developments of interoperable applications at minimal cost. Different sources of data consumed or produced by these applications can be integrated with existing systems and provide real-time information and metrics in a unified, integrated and understandable way.</p>

            <h3 class="card-journey-title">Digital Twins</h3>
            <p>Since its inception, DT is growing in momentum, especially when data-driven DTs are enhanced with advanced AI/ML approaches. To accelerate the adoption of DTs and facilitate DT creation, multiple standards are being considered, creating mappings between DT standard (e.g., DTDL) and manufacturing standards.</p>

            <h3 class="card-journey-title">Robotics</h3>
            <p>Robot operations easily adapt to changing demands, increase the digitization of physical activities, enable the convergence of operational and business information in holistic Digital Twin data representations, and reduce the time needed by experts for non-value added, repetitive or dangerous tasks. Digital Twins in this field are currently targeting the robust synchronisation between highly distributed digital models and real-time (often deeply embedded) robot data.</p>

            <h3 class="card-journey-title">Trustworthy AI</h3>
            <p>Increasing data and digital twin autonomy and continuity for the manufacturing industry, as with any other data-driven service, depends on stable and predictable statutory and legal rules. ML/AI approaches are relevant in conditions where raw data cannot be shared due to restrictions (e.g. legal, commercial) and additional security measures have to be applied to the trained models, such as encryption, for preventing unauthorised use of data.</p>

            <p>FIWARE is building reusable building blocks for establishing data relationships between trusted partners, exploiting industrial models and ontologies, while ensuring data sovereignty and trust (thanks to strong collaborations with iShare and IDSA) on federated edge-cloud infrastructures (based on the federation services promoted by Gaia-X).</p>

            <p>In todayâ€™s globalised and dynamic world, innovation is fundamental to economic development. Digital Industry is an organisational model based on the use of knowledge of different approaches, such as Data Spaces, and technologies as Robotics, which are adopted to ensure a competitive advantage, better business performance, and to meet customer demands.</p>

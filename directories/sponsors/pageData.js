The whole history of Naples is based on the concept of welcoming foreigners and of different cultures living side by side. The city&#x27;s enviable geographical position half-way down the Italian coast makes it easy to reach from anywhere in the world. The wonderful historical, artistic and archaeological heritage is an intrinsic part of the city.

Naples is a city on the sea, a place full of light yet with dark, hidden foundations. It has a great cultural and artistic identity which is stamped on the brow of its many museums, castles, churches, squares, narrow streets and archaeological remains.
